# Culture and Ethos (Work in progress)

Creative/knowledge-based professionals excel in certain kinds of environments.
How communication happens, leadership forms, and decisions are made all have a
huge impact on the ability to do a good job for such professionals.

## The Work

This work represents a set of values and thoughts around how to build
a company that everybody can care about. Perhaps it can form the basis
of employee handbooks and the likes, or simply be a public statement.

I hope that others will take this document or ones like it as a basis
for their own thoughts and that companies will use this for their
employees to see, interact, and collaborate on the very substance of
their company.

A lot of the content is super-idealistic but over time it will be toned
back to reality, where appropriate, through reasoned discussion and
personal experiences.

For now, it serves as a place to collect thoughts and start discussions.
There are no holy cows here, and everything is up for discussion or change.
I'm very interested in collecting others opinions, criticisms, experience,
and resources.
